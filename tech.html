<h1>
	My Three Favorite Books About Tech
</h1>
	<ol>
		<li class="padding">
		<em>Head First HTML and CSS - by: Elisabeth Robson</em><br>This is a great reader friendly guide to HTML and CSS, I read this book before starting my degree, and it has a lot of really fun exercises and cool websites to make as you follow along with the text. It's also got a lot of fun puzzles and illustrations that help you visualize the content. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to make websites!
		</li>
		<li class="padding">
		<em>CompTIA A+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, 8th Edition (Exams 220-801 & 220-802) - by: Michael Meyers</em><br>This is a great book for people looking to break in to the IT industry. This is the study guide that I used to pass the CompTIA A+ certification, which was a prerequisite for getting accepted in to the IT program at WGU. It's not dry and boring; it makes learning the basics of IT fun. I just hope the author isn't the same Michael Meyers as the one in the Halloween movies.
		</li>
		<li class="padding">
		<em>How Computers Work (9th Edition) - by: Ron White</em><br>This book covers much of the same material as the A+ certification study guide, although it's written more from an enthusiasts perspective, and is really meant more for entertainment. It's great for people who have always wondered how the technology we take for granted every day really works. When you delve deeper in to how these devices work you'll be amazed!
