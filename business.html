<h1>
	My Three Favorite Books About Business
</h1>
	<ol>
		<li class="padding">
		<em>Start Your Own Business, Fifth Edition: The Only Start-Up Book You'll Ever Need - by: The Staff of Entrepreneur Media</em><br>I like this book because it's simple, concise, and assumes you know nothing about business. This is a great book to get started on your journey to becoming a business guru.
		</li>
		<li class="padding">
		<em>Venture Deals: Be Smarter Than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist - by: Brad Feld</em><br>I like this book because it goes over how to get funding if you are starting a small business, or if you're wanting to take on a huge venture. This book caters to business enthusiasts at any level. It's very well written and entertaining. Venture Capital can seem nebulous at times; this book makes it digestible for people without an MBA.
		</li>
		<li class="padding">
		<em>The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing. A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition) - by: Benjamin Graham</em><br>This book is great for those who are interested in learning the basics of smart investing. The reason I like this book is because it doesn't promise any fool proof strategies for investing, and explains why those don't exist. The book instead teaches you how to be analytical about your investments, and how to rebound from a bad investment.
